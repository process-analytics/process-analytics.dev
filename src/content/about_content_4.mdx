The Process Analytics project provides a set of libraries that can be integrated into automation tools, process mining, Business Intelligence tools, RPA, services orchestration, and others.

These libraries will make it easy to render processes, human tasks, automatic and robotic (RPA) talks, and system-related execution data.
