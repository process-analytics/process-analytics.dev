* [About:](#about) Show the about section where you can write about who you are, what you like to do, etc. Also you can add a photo next to it!
* [Project:](#projects) Displays a card for all your project that you've made and also the posibility to link with github or and external link.
* [Writing:](#writing) Take the information about your medium user and show up to 6 stories as cards with the link to Medium.`,
